# Data Retrieval and Storage Scripts

This repository contains scripts for data retrieval, processing, and storage tasks using Python, SQLite, and REST APIs.

## Problem 1: Fetching and Storing Book Data

### Script: problem1.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook script fetches data from an external REST API that provides information about books in JSON format. It then stores this data in a local SQLite database and displays the retrieved data.



## Problem 2: Data Processing and Visualization

### Script: problem2.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook script fetches data from an API containing information about students' test scores, calculates the average score, and creates a bar chart to visualize the data.



## Problem 3: CSV Data Import to Database

### Script: problem3.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook script reads data from a CSV file containing user information (e.g., name, email) and inserts it into a SQLite database.
